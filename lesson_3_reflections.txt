To connect a local repo to a 'remote' repo (i.e. a repo on github)
Create a repo on github.
Next thing to do is to tell your local repo, the address of the remote repo.
git remote    to see what remote repos are there (if they are)
git remote add origin "https://address_of_the_repo_on_github.git"    remote repos are usually named, origin.
git remote -v    to view verbose info on the remote repo.
git push origin master    push the master branch of the local repo to the origin (remote)
This is how you initially setup the repos for github.
